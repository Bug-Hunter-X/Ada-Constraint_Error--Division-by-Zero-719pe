# Ada Constraint_Error: Division by Zero

This example demonstrates a common error in Ada: division by zero.  The program attempts to divide by the variable `Y`, which is initialized to 0, resulting in a `Constraint_Error` exception.

The solution shows how to handle this exception gracefully, preventing program crashes.  Robust error handling is essential for reliable Ada programs.
